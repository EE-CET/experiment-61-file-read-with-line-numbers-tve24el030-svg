# Experiment 61: File Read with Line Numbers

## Problem Statement

Write a program to read a text file named `input.txt` and display its contents on the console. Each line should be preceded by its line number. 
*(Note: Assume `input.txt` exists in the root of your project directory).*

## Important Note for File I/O
For file experiments, assume the input files (e.g., `input.txt`) are present in the working directory. Do **NOT** use absolute paths (e.g., `C:/Users/...`). Use relative paths (e.g., just `"input.txt"`).

## Input Format

* The program reads from `input.txt`. 
* No console input is required.

## Output Format

* `1: [content of line 1]`
* `2: [content of line 2]`

### Example

**Assume `input.txt` contains:**
```text
Hello World
Java Programming
```

**Output:**
```text
1: Hello World
2: Java Programming
```
